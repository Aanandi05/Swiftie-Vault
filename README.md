# 🎵 Swiftie Vault 🩷

A secure file vault inspired by Music Creation, built using Python.  
It encrypts your mp3 files with AES-256, verifies them with SHA-256, and stores them on Google Drive — all protected with OTP-based two-factor authentication.

---

## ✨ Motivation

I often imagined how artists might protect their unreleased music — which often gets leaked. While cloud services offer convenience, they often fall short on **true data privacy and integrity** — especially for individuals who need more than just a password.  

That's how **Swiftie Vault** was born — a love letter to secure storage, privacy, and my favorite artist 💗
